The quickest way of getting BoxWallet up and running.

Download the correct `bw_manager` file, for your system, and run it in the same directory that you'd like to install BoxWallet.

The BoxWallet Manager app will create a subfolder for the latest version (if it doesn't exist) and installs everything required to run BoxWallet in your browser.

e.g. If the latest version of BoxWallet is `0.0.5` a subfolder will be created called `v0.0.5` which will include a `run_boxwallet.bat` file.

Simply change to the directory and run the `run_boxwallet.bat` file and open your browser to `localhost:4000`

All done.
